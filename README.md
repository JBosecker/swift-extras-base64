The goal of this project is to provide an easy to use base64 encode and decode algorithm 
without the use of the Foundation framework. 

Everything began with [an issue](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/issues/1265) on [`swift-nio`](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio).


### Maybe one day, we can make this really swift.
